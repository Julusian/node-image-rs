**@julusian/image-rs** provides a minimal and performant wrapper around the [rust image](https://github.com/image-rs/image) library.

Please ask if you need more methods exposed.

## Requirements

All versions of Node still in [*active* Long-term Support](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-schedule) and the current development version are supported. Older versions may or may not work; they are not and will not be supported.

We provide prebuilds for many platforms. If your platform is not supported, open an issue and hopefully it can be enabled. If you need to build from source, you will require a rust toolchain to be available.
